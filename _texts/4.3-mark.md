# mark

Someone wandered through here a long time ago and all that’s left is the impression they made in the grass.[^35]

It almost looks like a comma...

[^35]: “When and animal, a rabbit, say, beds down in a protecting fencerow, the weight and warmth of his curled body leaves a mirroring mark upon the ground. The grasses often appear to have been woven into a birdlike nest, and perhaps were indeed caught and pulled around by the delicate claws as he turned in a circle before subsiding into rest. This soft bowl in the grasses, the body-formed evidence of hare, has a name, an obsolete but beautiful word: meuse.”  —Sally Mann, *Hold Still*
