My cat is researching sleep.[^21]

[^21]: “That’s the problem. Mankind has lost the ability to sleep.”  —*Solaris*, dir. Andrei Tarkovsky / “I know only one thing, señor. When I sleep, I know no fear, no hope, no trouble, no bliss. Blessings on him who invented sleep. The common coin that purchases all things, the balance that levels shepherd and king, fool and wise man. There is only one bad thing about sound sleep. They say it closely resembles death.” —Miguel De Cervantes, *Don Quixote*
