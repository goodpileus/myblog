# preparations

- You are only fruit. You may be violently blown from the tree or, after some time spent floating above the earth, you will suddenly fall to the ground.

- Resign yourself to disaster.

- Avoid American freeways.

- Document your face when the surface of the world is washed orange.

- Time is a great long blade and we are sprinting along its impossible edge. And, thanks to tremendous advances in technological development, we have managed to sharpen the blade!

- Inspire the Earth to continue it’s age-old pirouette by sliding your thumb (in unison with the other 7 billion thumbs) across the glass, lifting, returning to the bottom of the surface, and sliding up again.

- At some point, you will have seen your share of sunsets. It is not yet known if you will see any more after that point.
