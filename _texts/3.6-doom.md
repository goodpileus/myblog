# doom

I arrive at the same crisis. Between the new age and the old age, the bones and the exoskeleton, the sunrise and the sunset. I come to this moment saying doom. It is very easy. I join in the chorus of the great family of doomsayers. I am surrounded by so many adopted kin. The doomsayers have multiplied, but they all say the same thing—the same ancient doom. The branches of this family tree grow upwards at such a great speed and from my remote position on the ground, the branches look as if they wish to break the sky. I must learn how to stop saying doom.

I come to this moment seeking a moment to offer others a moment. I wonder where the moments have gone… The magic has evaporated—

- I cancel myself.

- When I leave I am replaced by a bench.
