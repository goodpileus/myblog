## trust

> Now, to trust the story, what does that mean? To me, it means being willing not to have full control over the story as you write it.[^1]

In order to begin we should first establish some trust. This is an unfortunate task—unfortunate because anything I can offer as a gesture of clarity or transparency will likely destroy this thing. So we must approach carefully.[^2]



​	I’ll begin with an admission.



I have called this text a guide, but, if you knew me, you would know that this is not really a guide; it cannot be a guide; it will not be a guide. Though this was not done without reason, I am sorry for the deception.  



From the genre of guide, it borrows the outlines and silhouettes and lines between things and spaces and ideas. It lingers on the shadows of its subject(s); it is attentive to the periphery of its world; but it cannot take you there. There is no there. It lacks the authority of the guide; it lacks the lucidity, the efficiency, the false totality of the guide; it lacks the confidence.



I do not know where this guide is going. I cannot assume to know. The great shame[^3] of this guide is that I am somehow always at the center of it. What is a guide built around shame? What is a guide that interfaces with chaos instead of the rational? What is a guide formed from the twisting mists of a human heart?



The guide simultaneously faces the user and the interior of the screen. Like Janus, the guide exists at the doorway, presiding over who can see what lies beyond. Like Janus, it contradicts itself: despairing and rejoicing, seeing nothing and everything, destroying itself and reassembling itself. Unlike Janus, the guide does not want this control.[^4]



The guide embodies its own anxieties. This makes sense, as its reason to exist was born on the one-way highway of technological determinism and cradled in the eclipse of nihilism. It is from the gravity of these contexts that the guide is trying to escape[^5] or is (more likely) propelled by, into its own certain and empty end. This is the only language the guide has seemingly ever known. 



​	The guide is not convinced of itself.



The guide is sapped of its mana—but this is the natural state of this guide. If this condition is not met, the guide would cease to exist. It functions only in this exhausted state.



The guide is an act of forgetting. It refrains into itself. The plots and pages have been tended, the instruments have been tuned, the dust has been arranged.



The guide is more like a chamber than a tool; more like a vehicle moving between things (cities or stars); more like a cry; more like a memory and more like a simulation. A simulation of lying on the ground with nothing to do. 



What is contained here is probably nothing more than a collection of echoes.[^6]



I do not want this to be an unwelcoming place.

## download

Visit https://fools.rest to download the latest version of Fool’s Rest.



If, when you visit, the website has blown along on the gusts of time and no longer resides in that place, you can track down the author, Aidan Quinlan, and contact them in whatever way is the popular or proper mode of contacting someone at the time. If Aidan has died or disappeared, then forgive me, as the software has most likely also blown along on those same gusts that both the website and Aidan have been carried off by. But, it seems strange to me that I imagine myself as the only one capable of out-living the others. I seem to be placing more trust than I usually do in the institution that I am housed within and in the rhythms of history——more trust than I should probably sustain——in assuming that the world will choose to keep me around even while Aidan still lives. But, in my defense, this book is partly about establishing trust (though not necessarily with the academy or the terrible machinery of history) and maybe I’ve just caught the bug of trust… 



At the time of this writing, Fool’s Rest is only compatible with macOS. 


More support will be added later.



To open the software (on mac), one must first establish trust...



Attempts to open without first establishing trust will only result in prompts from the operating system to discard this piece of software into the trash.



To avoid this, the user must right click on the application and select “open” from the drop-down menu. A new dialog will appear, this time with the option of opening the application.



Only do this if you trust me.



Be mindful of this software, as it is delicate. It is known to disappear or terminate itself if efforts to control it are made.

## panic

I tremble with un-academic panic.[^7] It is the same cold panic that has been trembled collectively since our earliest moments. The fantasy[^8] appears: very hot air (but still, the panic is cold) ; a river within a wilderness and a community of small figures, carried along the river, stranded on vessels of certainty: appendages of glass and transmission, boxes of words and mythologies, technologies of measurement and hope. The community watches the sunset. They watch with growing worry. Eventually, they set to work on building a singular vessel of certainty—a Great Net to catch the sun before it passes below the horizon. Faster and faster… The worry must be put to rest, once and for all.

> Evil arises in the honored belief that history can be tidied up, brought to a sensible conclusion. It is evil to act as though the past is bringing us to a specifiable end.[^9]

------

> I want to share my emptiness with you. Not fill the silence with false notes, or put tracks through the void. I want to share this wilderness of failure. The others have built you a highway—fast lanes in both directions. I offer you a journey without direction. Uncertainty and no sweet conclusion. When the light faded, I went in search of myself. There were many paths and many destinations.[^10]

## orientation

A gust of blackberry and plastic, ponderosa pine and aluminum, damp grass and lithium. I am moving along a narrow path between two cliffs of bushes. My heart is fidgeting darkly. I have no therapist but they would probably give me a drug for that. The sky above the dark green canyon is slowly turning red as the sun (obscured by the bushes) is moving toward the limit of the day. This maze is a terrible shelter for the night. I should hurry. I want to get home. The thorns look ready to sink themselves into me and the berries look ready to turn into dark wisps of soot. I have already ingested too much dust. It is clouding my heart (where I keep the memory of home). 

​	I move further along the path. A thorn claims a sliver of land on my arm, evicting some blood. This place used to be a refuge. I pull a blackberry off a branch and eat it in order to remember sourly. The tang of glass within fiber optic cable fills my mouth and plumes into a bristling cloud of memory loss. Misting its way through my throat, I can sense its eagerness to mingle with the cloud of dust hovering around my heart. I almost run into the big bug. The big bug with a red gleam, hissing unkindnesses. I’ve been here before. Another song of unkindness. More dust is heaped into my mouth by the shoveling claws of the bug. Once again, I turn and crawl through a small tunnel in the bushes. More thorns and more landlords. More dust and no water. 



Suddenly, a red sensation. The cloud dissipates a little. I look ahead and see that the tunnel is ending. Red all over. The red sun flashes a jet of fire into my eyes. Suddenly, I am out of the tunnel; suddenly, a sick feeling in my stomach; suddenly, there it is.

------

I notice I am monologuing to myself, as I always seem to be—though it seems these words were meant for others...



I come to this moment by way of the glass surface and the land of myth behind the glass. I come to this moment weary and waterlogged, restless and thirsty. The sprawling rivers of information that pour from the containers of the devices have carried me a long way from the dreams that once defined my time within the screen. I am there, somewhere in the froth of the waves. I attempt to steer away from the dogma of the Feed. I attempt to reassemble and understand the magic that has disappeared. There is much that I have forgotten in the great force and velocity of these rivers.



I come to this moment in earnest, feeling around for a slower way of doing and seeing things. At times I feel sick with information and so I wonder about ‘information’ and ‘acceleration’ and ‘seamlessness’ and the limits of these things. I wonder about the side-effects of a world preoccupied with lucidity and hardness and data and speculation. And I wonder how I can place stones in the rushing stream(s) of all these things so there might be some space(s) to take a rest.



I come to this moment by way of the desert and the clouded coast of the North American expanse. I am still looking for a parking place. I fear I may never find one. At one point, I traversed a long distance on my bicycle, where I didn’t do much except pay attention to the strength of the wind and the frequency of corn fields and the precarity of the highway shoulder. At another, I was carried along a winding river, deep in a canyon, fearing what is called “the hole” in the rapids. I never encountered the hole and instead found the eddy, nestled along the banks of the river or tucked against the western face of a stone in the middle of the flow, silently twisting into itself.



As you might expect, I’ve since encountered the hole and, with the swift violence of reality (and eager submission on my part), my heart was wrenched away and cast into the breezeless mouth.

------

## beginning

At the moment, my attention has drifted to the background—distracted by encompassing mists, patterns of weather, echoes. I am often lost in the background. At the moment, my attention dwells on the experience of fatigue and the disposition of the soft and hidden and the language that creates the outline of such a disposition—language that gestures to the possibility of existing with such a disposition. At the moment, I am slowly moving out of the many shells of irony that I’ve built around my delicate spirit (I flinch).



I begin (or attempt to begin) with waiting and finding. Ursula K. Le Guin reminds me: 

> Waiting, of course, is a very large part of writing.



I begin in bed. Outside the window is a brick wall. The sun has yet to stretch a ribbon of warmth through the narrow hallway between. This won’t happen until three. And when it does, it will last for thirty minutes.



I begin on the surface of the screen. Caught in the filament of that nearly opaque net, thrashing but incapacitated (indoctrinated?) and deeply in love. But maybe love is not the right word. Love belongs to some time outside of now. Things move too fast for love. The contrast is too high for love. You might think that love thrives in high contrast, claiming dominion over one end of the spectrum, but really it rests somewhere between, off a path into the damp dark. Everything comes back as radio static. There is unbearable noise, heaviness, even more. A moment of panic and the fear of great loss. The searing light from the screen turns the already limited 9am light into a deep pitch of black. Ged yawns and the panel of light becomes a blur in the foreground. He presses himself against my leg. A stretched paw in my direction. The left eye closes before the right eye… 

​	Ecstatic experience generally only happens when I am watching my cat.[^11]



I begin with something happening; something beginning and getting lost; distracted by a glowing, distracted by a word, the scent of a trail I am not supposed to be on. I arrive slowly, and in truth I do not arrive at all. I’m sorry… There is likely nothing juicy here, nothing sexy and electric, only a hidden fire in a little stone, something so old that we passed right by it. The reality of the stone does not seem to matter. 

​	

Really, I’m sorry for all this.



I begin with an apology: I arrive bearing no solution, no certain position to the problems at hand. I carry only tools of uncertainty, methods of weathering. My snake oils and ointments tumble out of my hands and crash on the floor. I bend to pick them up again, apologetic, repentant. I have set out with no plans and I can barely articulate the Vision.[^12] I have tried to go off,[^13] tried to go the dark way, the way of the gut—tried to follow the heart. This has proved difficult. I’ve submerged myself in worry.

## worry

I worried all night. 



Thank you to the angels who lifted me from the hole, even though I continued to worry. Worry about worry about worry about worry. The whole world vibrating with worry. Something is wrong—but it’s okay to worry. 

​	I worry that I will not transcend the primal state of worry. I worry that I cannot go over it, I cannot go under it, I cannot go around it. I must go through it. 

​	The sun is setting and I feel the urge to find shelter.



I worry until a gem emerges from my throat. I attempt to proclaim it—to reclaim it. I make a sign that reads: 

> In This House,
> We Worry



I hang it in the kitchen. I move in with the inevitability. I cook with it, I laugh with it, I love with it, I am annihilated by it.



Worry is a thing placed next to hope. Maybe it is the shadow of hope. And, like all shadows, it is a thing despised and neglected; a thing to be destroyed and forgotten; a thing to re-approach and re-consider. I sheepishly look in its general direction and am suddenly overcome. Or—I sheepishly look in its general direction and find it temporarily tamed, a sickly sun, purring like a cat.



What I understand about my worrying is purely self-diagnostic—so, much of what I say is most likely projection, posturing myself in a brighter light (for self-defense or maybe subconsciously for my own sake so that I don’t spiral into a greater storm of worry). I see myself. I see an automaton of behaviors and mythologies, trapped in the bind of nihilism—a horizonless limit immediately before me. Nihilism eventually turning into fatalism. Rationality slipping into solipsistic singularity.

## ambiguation

The river runs downhill. The certainty of the end of the river pulls with great magnetic strength. But the river’s terrain is not only defined by the pull of its current—it is populated with moments of punctuation:

​	sandbars,

​	sweepers,

​	strainers,

​	boulders,

​	plummets,    

​	boils,

​	holes,    

​	eddies. Hazards and havens. The hole yearns to drown. The eddy offers pause. The eddy and the hole form on the same principle: a fixed object obstructs the flow of water downstream, leaving a void on the opposite side of the object to be refilled by the river with a circulating flow of water moving upstream and back down again. The eddy is created by an object visible above the surface and the hole by an object hidden below. 

> Like all walls it was ambiguous, two faced. What was inside it and what was outside it depended on which side of it you were on.[^14]

------

## ending

> If there was only one of anything, it would be the end of the world.[^15]

Here we are, arrived at the End. Foretold in our stories and our physics; presaged on street corners and all along the ever-descending, ever-ascending tower of the Timeline. Fixated on endings, fixated on solutions and destinations, fixated in general.

​	With this perspective, it is evil to get distracted, to go off, to seek elsewhere, outside—but fixation is a distraction in another sense. Fixation and certainty are just the physics of dogma—and I often find myself vigorously rowing my boat down the rapids of dogma, toward the logical end.



Like so many, I fixate on the apocalypse. Apocalypse as the death of love. Love as a dark thing; a cave untethered from time. Not evil, not good, not stable, but moving, from between my fingers. 

Love as worrying; Love in the big sense; Love as the secret language, resting, obscured by impossibly dense mists, in the hearts of the star, the stone, the human, the cat, the atom...

​	Love as an ungraspable tremor. 



Forgive me for all this talk about love. I have misplaced it. Misplaced it with language; misplaced it with truth; misplaced it in a twist of time.

> here is a sun setting

Our capacity for attention has been numbed and erased by the immediacy of the interface. We see the button. The button signifies immediate progress: 	

​	summon the ride, 
​	summon the desire, 
​	summon the end.

## red

> The red world and corresponding red breezes 
> Went on Geryon did not[^16]

Red sometimes appears to be the saddest color. An anxious, longing sad, tinged with neu-roses. A sad that can’t sit still. Sad that’s been left in the sun too long. Irradiated sadness. The sadness of the flushed, embarrassed face. Sad red exhaustion. Red is often the color given to the apocalypse—the fires of hell embracing the earth, the heat of climate collapse, the red-orange mists of industry choking cities and hills. Or, at least, red is the moment before the long end. A flash of sad red energy before everything cools down and separates into cold, isolated matter.



> Red is rare in the landscape. It gains its strength through its absence. Momentarily, in an ecstatic sunset, the great globe of the sun sinking below the horizon … then it’s gone. I’ve never seen the legendary green flash. Remember, great sunsets are the consequences of violence and cataclysm, Krakatoa and Popocatepetl.[^17]



I make a sunset to ward off dread. A personal symbol of a momentary end within a larger cycle of things. A moment to pay attention to mundane celestial weather. 



A signal to return home.

Scattered like so many eggs. The festival is over or the festival is elsewhere and we will never find it again—only remnants—or we learn that the festival never really existed or that it partially existed—existed only because it didn’t exist for others.

the egg offers a crisis;

Carefulness is holding oneself and one’s acts in appropriate relation and proportion to the many other beings and intentions. To take is to be joyless.

To essay is to try but not to attempt. It is to establish trial. The essay is the most human literary form in that it is always sure, it remains from first to last fixed.” —William Carlos Williams, *An Essay On Virginia*
[^8]: “So the word fantasy remains ambiguous, standing between the false, the foolish, the delusory, the shallows of the mind, and the mind’s deep connection with the real. On this threshold it sometimes faces one way, masked and costumed, frivolous, and escapist; then it turns, and we glimpse as it turns the face of an angel, bright truthful messenger, arisen Urizen.”  —	Ursula K.

Centuries of their labor would not reveal to them any more of Creation than they already knew. Yet through their endeavor, men would glimpse the unimaginable artistry of Yahweh’s work, in seeing how ingeniously the world had been constructed.

[^24]: “When taken seriously, the Sabbath has the power to restructure not only the calendar but also the entire political economy. In place of an economy built upon the profit motive—the ever-present need for more, in fact the need for there to never be enough—the Sabbath puts forward an economy built upon the belief that there is enough. But few who observe the Sabbath are willing to consider its full implications, and therefore few who do not observe it have reason to find any value in it. … In a Sabbatarian economy, the right to rest—the right to do nothing of value to capital—is as holy as the right to work.”  — William R. Black, *Let’s bring back the Sabbath as a radical act against ‘total work’*
[^25]: “The black mirror—an ancient gadget used by artists, magicians, and scientists from Mexico to India—offers an insight into another history of ‘techné’ that connected art, science, and magic, producing an enchanted technology of wonder. When a digital surface becomes a ‘black mirror,’ it reflects upon clashing forms of modern and premodern experience that coexist in contemporary culture. New ‘black mirrors’ engage with pictorial and photographic genres of the past to document a confrontation of modern industrial ruins and virtual utopias.”  —Svetlana Boym, *The Off-Modern* / “If the black mirror is charged with passion, it is charged above all with poison—as were mirrors made with mercury. Thus, although this mirror does not necessarily provoke melancholy, it is quite apt to maintain it, if not actually to darken our minds, just like this black exhalation.”  —Arnaud Maillet, *The Claude Glass*
[^26]: “Think of the darkness and the great cold / In this valley, which resounds with misery.” —Brecht, *Threepenny Opera*
[^27]: “I was born in a country of brooks and rivers, in a great corner of Champagne, called le Vallage for the great number of its valleys. The most beautiful of its places for me was the hollow of a valley by the side of fresh water, in the shade of willows… My Pleasure still is to follow the stream, to walk along its banks in the right direction, in the direction of the flowing water, the water that leads life towards the next village…   But our native country is less an expanse of territory than a substance; it’s a rock or a soil or an aridity or a water or a light. It’s the place where our dreams materialize; it’s through that place that our dreams materialize; it’s through that place that our dreams take on their proper form…Dreaming beside the river, I gave my imagination to the water, the green, clear water, the water that makes the meadows green. I can’t sit beside a brook without falling into a deep reverie, without seeing once again my happiness… The stream doesn’t have to be ours; the water doesn’t have to be ours. The anonymous water knows all my secrets. And the same memory issues from every spring.”  —Gaston Bachelard, *Water and Dreams*
[^28]: “Perhaps men were not meant to live in such a place. If their own natures restrained them from approaching heaven too closely, then men should remain on the earth.  When they reached the summit of the tower, the disorientation faded, or perhaps they had grown immune. Here, standing upon the square platform of the top, the miners gazed upon the most awesome scene ever glimpsed by men: far below them lay a tapestry of soil and sea, veiled by mist, rolling out in all directions to the limit of the eye. Just above them hung the roof of the world itself, the absolute upper demarcation of the sky, guaranteeing their vantage point as the highest possible. Here was as much of Creation as could be apprehended at once.” —Ted Chiang, *Tower of Babylon*
[^29]: Scott Burton, whose later works were composed mainly of functional public benches/seating, remarked that his work should, “place itself not in front of, but around, behind, underneath (literally) the audience.” / “A bench, in our modern gardens, is a thing to be sat upon; in Shenstone’s Leasowes it was a thing to be read.”  —Ian Hamilton Finlay, *Selections*
[^30]: “I’m not proposing a return to the Stone Age. My intent is not reactionary, nor even conservative, but simply subversive. It seems that the utopian imagination is trapped, like capitalism and industrialism and the human population, in a one-way future consisting only of growth. All I’m trying to do is figure out how to put a pig on the tracks. Go backward. Turn and return.” —Ursula K. Le Guin, *A Non-Euclidean View   of California*
[^31]: “The gardener digs in another time, without past or future, beginning or end. A time that does not cleave the day with rush hours. Lunch breaks, the last bus home.

[^52]: “The words ‘if only’ mark both the fact of loss, that it is too late, yet simultaneously the possibility that things might have been different, that the fantasy could have been fulfilled.” —Steve Neale, *Melodrama and Tears*
[^53]: “One’s dreams are attuned to the specter of death, death is a ghost, and the ghost’s form is fixed: Its shape, a body, appears in the mist, is difficult to perceive. Its shape, a body, extends one arm up toward the sky, points a finger. Gradually, a roar of sound descends. The clouds break open: pour cylindrical containers, gallons upon gallons of tears. Tears, fluid content that pours from the eyes to disinfect the eyes, transpire only when the eyes are diseased. Is a ghost ashamed of its tears, its disease? Does the ghost tremble in dreams?”  —Claire Donato, *Burial*

The just weren’t paying attention.”  —Ted Chiang, *The Great Silence* / “Listening is an act of community, which takes space, time and, silence. Reading is a means of listening. Reading is not as passive as hearing or viewing. It’s an act: you do it. You read at your pace, your own speed, not the ceaseless, incoherent, gabbling, shouting rush of the media.”  —Ursula K. Le Guin, *Operating Instructions*
